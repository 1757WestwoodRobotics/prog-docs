# Challenge 8

*This challenge is intended to be taken after the [modules](../modules.md) section.*

## Problem 1: Custom Module

1.  Create a new file called `greetings.py`.
2.  In `greetings.py`, define a function called `say_hello(name)` that returns a string "Hello, {name}!".
3.  In the editor below, import the `greetings` module and use the `say_hello` function to greet a user.

```py
# Assume greetings.py exists
# Your code here

```

## Problem 2: Using the `math` module

- Ask the user to enter the radius of a circle.
- Use the `math` module to get the value of PI and to calculate the area of the circle (Area = Ï€ * r^2).
- Print the calculated area.

```py

```

## Problem 3: Number Guessing Game

- Use the `random` module to generate a random integer between 1 and 100.
- Create a loop that asks the user to guess the number.
- After each guess, tell the user if their guess was too high or too low.
- The loop should end when the user guesses the correct number.

```py

```
