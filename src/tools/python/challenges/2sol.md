# Solution

- Create a program that allows the user to enter a word/phrase, and outputs the first letter of that word/phrase
```py
word = "Wolverines" # change this
print(word[0])
```
- Create a list with one string of your choice in it
- Then prompt the user to enter a number, and add that number to the list. Then add the result of multiplying your number by 2 to the list. Then print the list
	- Ex. `[“Apple”, 10, 20]`    
	- `[“Mousepad”, 13, 26]`

```py
list = ["Cargo"]
number = 10 # change this

list.append(number)
list.append(2 * number)
print(list)
```
