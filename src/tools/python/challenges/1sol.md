# Solution

- Create a program that allows the user to enter a number, and then outputs triple that number
     
```py
number = int(input())
print(3 * number)
```

- Create a program that allows the user to enter a word/phrase, and then outputs the lengths of that word/phrase

```py
phrase = input()
print(len(phrase))
```
