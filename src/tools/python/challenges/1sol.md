# Solution

- Create a program that allows the user to enter a number, and then outputs triple that number
     
```py
number = 2 # change this variable
print(3 * number)
```

- Create a program that allows the user to enter a word/phrase, and then outputs the lengths of that word/phrase

```py
phrase = "words" # change this
print(len(phrase))
```
