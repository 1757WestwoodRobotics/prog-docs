### Basic basic super basic console IO
if we want to talk to the world, we can use `print` in order to put output. By default, nothing will print out with bare words
```py
print("Hello World!")
```
```py
1+1 # does not get printed
print(1+1) # does print out 2
```

If we want to take input from the user, we can use the `input` keyword

```py
print("What is your name?")
name = input()
print(f"Hello, {name}") # you will learn about every part of this later
```
