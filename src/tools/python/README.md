# Python

Python! The programming language of choice for 1757. You can download python at [https://python.org](https://python.org) however I highly suggest not, instead using a package manager. More instructions can be found in [installation](installation.md) section

Below is a REPL you can mess with
```py
# This is an editable document
print("Hello world!")
```

The next few sections are tutorials if you need to learn python

Absolutely every single section in this python area is editable, please feel free to mess with every example!!!
