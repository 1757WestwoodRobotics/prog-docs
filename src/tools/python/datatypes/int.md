# Integer
integers are any non-decimal number essentially. Examples include 

```py
3 # is the number 3
```

We can do math on integers
```py
# Math is what you would expect
print(1 + 1)   # => 2
print(8 - 1)   # => 7
print(10 * 2)  # => 20
print(35 / 5)  # => 7.0
```

note that last answer, `7.0`, not as `7`, thats our next datatype, `Float` or floating point number. 
If you want to do specifically integer division, that is done with `//`

```py
# Floor division rounds towards negative infinity
print(5 // 3)       # => 1
print(-5 // 3)      # => -2
print(5.0 // 3.0)   # => 1.0  # works on floats too
print(-5.0 // 3.0)  # => -2.0
```
