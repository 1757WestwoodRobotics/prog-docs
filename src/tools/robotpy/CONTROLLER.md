# Controllers

Controllers are a fundamental part of robotics, and RobotPy provides a variety of built-in controllers that you can use to control your robot's mechanisms. This section will provide an overview of the different types of controllers available in RobotPy and how to use them.

The following pages will cover:

-   **Bang-Bang:** A simple controller that is either on or off.
-   **PID:** A more advanced controller that uses feedback to improve accuracy.
-   **PIDF:** An extension of the PID controller that adds a feedforward term.
-   **Ramsete:** A controller specifically designed for path following.
-   **Higher-Order Controllers:** More advanced controllers that can be used for more complex systems.
