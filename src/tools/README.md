# Tools

This contains a list of tools that we use
- [RobotPY](./robotpy/REATDME.md) - the actual framework that extends [wpilib](./wpilib.md) into a python environment to run on the robot
- [Python](python/README.md) - the programming language that we as a team use do to its simplicity for quick development vs the more standard Java or C++ that most other teams utilize
- [Linux](./linux.md) - the [RoboRio](hardware/roborio.md) is not a very powerful computer, and runs a custom linux distribution. Familiarity with linux is helpful for debugging issues with the roborio.
